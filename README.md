# Jenealogio 2

A user-friendly, inclusive and non-spying family tree manager. This app will *never* send
your data and files anywhere or to anyone.

**This application is currently under active developpement. As such, tree files’ structure may change during this time
and until the official launch, with no guarantee of retro-compatibility.**

You can follow planned features and developpement progress over on the
project’s [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/PsvxkYIB).
